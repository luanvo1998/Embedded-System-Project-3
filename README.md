# Embedded-System-Project-3

Generated 100Hz, 1000Hz, and 10KHz clock frequency using a combination of hardware and software time stamping to compensate for delays from solely software time stamping.
Demonstrated that hardware timestamping could increase the timestamping accuracy by up to 9 times, while recovering 104% (with 4% overheads) of data points at mean of 9.573 KHz.  

This project was made for ECE 231 - UMass Amherst in Spring 2020
